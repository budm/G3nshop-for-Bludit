# budm's G3Nshop plugin + theme | Ecommerce for Bludit 3.8
Introducing Budm's Variant of G3Nshop Plugin and Theme. 

This Variant adds a large amount of new features to develop a more professional ecommerce solution, while running on the lightweight Bludit platform. Built originally for my own needs, I'm keeping with the open source nature of the original script and releasing all my changes for free, and to the public. 

If you find any bugs, or make any changes let me know, I'm always looking to addon to the plugin. 

PHP 7.1 or better

## **Changes/Improvements**

- Translated some stuff from Spanish to English
- Unified colorscheme
- Removed sidebars
- Removed tags from product page
- Rearranged the layout of the product page
- Added/enabled the ability to order multiple quantities of product
- Added Share options to products

and more features to come.

### **Installation**:

Copy the folder G3Nshop_plug in bl-plugins, and the folder G3Nshop_theme in bl-themes.
Enter the Admin. Active the plugin, configure the plugin, and enable the theme.

### **Example content**:

**Caution !!!**

**Example content has not been tested with per product shipping, and may not work. I'll be working on adding per product shipping examples later.**

**This will erase the current content that you could have in bludit.**

If you want to test the application you can use the bl-contet folder to replace your content with the example content.
It is useful for installations from 0, or installations with the intention of development or testing.
